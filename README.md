The R markdown file [WaterFlow_Sector229.Rmd](https://github.com/THouwe/timeSeriesForecasting_waterInflow_R/blob/main/WaterFlow_Sector229.Rmd) shows how to pre-process and analyze time-series (TS) data. A description in Italian is provided in the file file [WaterFlow_Sector229.html](https://github.com/THouwe/timeSeriesForecasting_waterInflow_R/blob/main/WaterFlow_Sector229.html).
The data captures water inflow in a sector of one Italian city.
In the script above, I show how to explore the properties of the TS, such as its seasonalities (e.g., through autocorrelation)...

...or its trends (e.g., through the moving averages).
